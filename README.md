We strive to enhance efficient data management, seamless information exchange, and improved clinical decision-making. I used **Python** to build prototype and deployed it on the **AWS** cloud. In this project I encountered obstacles in data encrytion, verifycation, store data in blockchain. However, the prototype failed because I could not re-encrytion cryphertext of AES to cryphertext of HE.

### Software Engineering  : Software Requirements Specification for Art-Horizon
[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRKjNUw23O-g4FHty5vLnIuvr4xVuOcf/view)

Designing an online art marketplace website provides a digital platform that enables users to buy, sell, and bid on both physical and digital artworks. The design includes a product overview, product functionality, specific requirements, and non-functional requirements. In this project, we developed many functions and use cases, which made our project twice as large as the other groups

### Scientific Computing : Analyzing the Impact of Economic Prosperity and Healthcare Quality on Birth Rates in Thailand (1960–2022)

I used **MATLAB** to analyze the impact of economic prosperity and healthcare quality on birth rates since 1960, applying five different models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression (Degree2), Polynomial Regression (Degree3), Linear Regression (Power function), Linear Regression (Rational function with Logarithmic Denominator). 
We find A negative correlation exists between birth rate and infant mortality rate, as improved healthcare reduces child mortality and the need for larger families. Similarly, birth rate negatively correlates with GDP per capita, as higher economic prosperity in wealthier societies often leads to lower fertility rates.

### Database Programming Laboratory  : Commart Event Redemption Management System 
[Slide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVDMWG7lw/Fn3qbUUPdlrgzJ8QqYDSZw/edit)

Used **PHP**, **CSS** and **SQL** to build Commart event redemption management system. The project involved designing the database structure as well as developing both the front-end and back-end. During development, I identified several issues in the database system, with the most critical being the lack of SQL injection protection.


### Database systems : Analysis and Design to Database Implementation

We used an animate website as a model to design an Enhanced ER Diagram, build the database and add sample data using **SQL** queries.
